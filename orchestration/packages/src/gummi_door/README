Instructions for running gummi_door package.

Follow GummiArm setup instructions at: https://github.com/mstoelen/GummiArm/wiki/Installing
and install the moveit branch with console command $ git branch moveit.
Connect laptop to GummiArm
Make sure all tendons have no slack
Open console 
$ cd GummiArm/orchestration/packages
open three new tabs and on each:
$ source devel/setup.bash
First tab:
$ roslaunch gummi_dynamixel manager.launch
Second tab:
$ roslaunch gummi_dynamixel controllers.launch
once complete
$ roslaunch gummi_door number1.launch
Will open an OpenCV window, once the doorhandle is acquired (white box around it):
Third tab:
$ roslaunch gummi_door transformer.launch
Will open RVIZ and you will see a representation of the arm, door and handle.
From here door opening is autonomous.
Works best from ~60cm distance from handle to centre of GummiArm shoulder yaw joint and perpendicular to the door
but can work from 50 to 70 cm distance and up to 30 deg from perpendicular either side.
